# Python grading system

    - Run and enter the four marks representing the four subjects, maths, physics, geography and chemistry
    - The program will calculate the average and print the grade alongside the average used to deduce the grade.
    - If an invalid mark for any subject i.e marks less than 0 or greater than 100 the program assigns the grade amd average a value of -1 to indicate an error occurred during computation
